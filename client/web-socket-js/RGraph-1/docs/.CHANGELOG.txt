 28th November 2009
 ==================
 o [DOCS] Added RGraph.HideContext() to API documentation.
 o [MISC] Simplified logic for showing the context menu. Please test your browser on the website before upgrading as this may
          cause regressions.
 o [MISC] Fixed slight oddity for zoom which resulted in a small zoom thumbnail
 o [MISC] The RGraph website now works with Google Chrome Frame. NB: If you're having a similar problem, ensure the META
          tag is in the first 1Kb of the page.
 o [MISC] Achieved a degree of Opera compatibility. Please bear in mind that Opera does not yet support the canvas text
          or shadow APIs so do not expect to see any shadows on your graphs. Text is simulated however, so the graphs
          are still usable in some circumstances however. Also bear in mind that Opera support is buggy.

 20th November 2009
 ==================
  o [MISC] Added new mode for zoom - thumbnail This shows a zoom thumbnail (you must set chart.zoom.mode to thumbnail) instead of
           zooming the entire canvas. The line graph on the front page shows an example of it.

           The second to last two line chart examples show this in action
  o [LINE] Added an interesting example showing off the new independence of labels, datapoints and tickmarks. The ninth
           line example (the sin/cos/tan curves) has 361 datapoints but only 5 labels - 361 labels would be a bit much.

    | IMPORTANT !                                                                                                      |
    | Every single one of the property names has been changed to be a little more unified. The new format is now       |
    | "chart.xxx" where xxx is the actual name. Some of the names have been changed completely, eg. "chart.text.size", |
    | which was formerly "textheight", whilst others only marginally. This was necessary to bring some semblance of    |
    | uniformity to the RGraph properties across all of the libraries, make it look a bit more "proffessional" and     |
    | provide plenty of scope for future properties.                                                                   |
    |                                                                                                                  |
    | You should also note that as of this release (14th March 2009) that RGraph has been changed to use the canvas    |
    | text and shadow APIs. This may mean you needing to upgrade your browser if you want to use the latest version.   |
    | At the time of writing, this meant Firefox 3.1b2, Safari 4 and Chrome 2. If you don't wish to upgrade your       |
    | browser, or need Opera support, then you will need to remain on the 28th February 2009 version.                  |

           | Use unified better getters/setters for all charts. This is a MAJOR update, since it affects all the |
           | charts in a fundamental way. For the better. Any update should be done cautiously. But since        |
           | RGraph is beta, all updates should be done that way. Judging by the RGraph test page though,        |
           | everything seems fine.                                                                              |
